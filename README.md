# Home Credit Defaulter Predictor
The Python Notebook provided in the repository predicts whether a person trying to avail a loan is capable of not defaulting the loan. The data that is used to perform this prediction is available from the below Kaggle Link -

https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

To briefly explain the dataset, it consists of personal and financial information of people but does not contain any PII Data.

This notebook was initially developed in Colab and hence the dataset reading has a different procedure than usual which involves reading through a Google Drive. Please change the code to read through a local directory or as per your preferred method.

# Development
Most of the explanation is provided in the notebook itself in the markdown section. Individual parts of the Data Mining process can be replaced with some other procedure to try out different methods. More Machine Learning mechanisms can be added as well. Results can then be evaluated using the F1 Score and Recall section to check the results. It is not recommended to change the Data Preparation part unless you wish to implement Feature Selection.
